        Information technology (IT) is the study or use of computers, telecommunication systems and other devices to create, process, store, retrieve and transmit information.
        While the term is commonly used to refer to computers and computer networks, it also encompasses other information distribution technologies such as television and telephones.
        Information technology is an application of computer science and computer engineering. An information technology system (IT system) is generally an information system,
        a communications system, or, more specifically speaking, a computer system — including all hardware, software, and peripheral equipment — operated by a limited group of IT users,
        and an IT project usually refers to the commissioning and implementation of an IT system. IT systems play a vital role in facilitating efficient data management,
        enhancing communication networks, and supporting organizational processes across various industries. Successful IT projects require meticulous planning and ongoing
        maintenance to ensure optimal functionality and alignment with organizational objectives.

            <h3>History</h3>
            <p>Ideas of computer science were first mentioned before the 1950s under the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and Harvard University,
                where they had discussed and began thinking of computer circuits and numerical calculations. As time went on, the field of information technology and computer science
                became more complex and was able to handle the processing of more data. Scholarly articles began to be published from different organizations.

            <h3>Data processing</h3>
           <p>Electronic data processing or business information processing can refer to the use of automated methods to process commercial data.
            Typically, this uses relatively simple, repetitive activities to process large volumes of similar information. For example: stock updates applied to an inventory,
            banking transactions applied to account and customer master files, booking and ticketing transactions to an airline's reservation system, billing for utility services.
            The modifier "electronic" or "automatic" was used with "data processing" (DP), especially c. 1960, to distinguish human clerical data processing from that done by computer.

            <h3>Commercial effects</h3>
            <p>Companies in the information technology field are often discussed as a group as the "tech sector" or the "tech industry."
                These titles can be misleading at times and should not be mistaken for "tech companies," which are generally large scale,
                for-profit corporations that sell consumer technology and software. From a business perspective, information technology departments
                are a "cost center" the majority of the time. A cost center is a department or staff which incurs expenses, or "costs,"
                within a company rather than generating profits or revenue streams.
